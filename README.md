The dataset name is 'indian_food.csv'. I picked up this data file from Kaggle to practice data cleaning. What's different in this dataset from my first project is that, here the presence of -1 in any of the columns indicates NaN value or missing value. Below is the desciption of this data file:

# Content
Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions.

Here I mainly practiced data cleaning and a little bit of data visualization. My notebook is labelled 'Indian Food.ipynb'.
